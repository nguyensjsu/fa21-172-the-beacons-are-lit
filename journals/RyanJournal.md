I was assigned to work on our payments API and integrating it with cybersource. I imported the code from lab7 spring payments and updated it according to what was necessary for our project.

I first started by creating a team cybersource account then generating a key to be used for our API.
```
cybersource.merchantkeyid=5bd25a12-0866-41b3-8032-d0f2cbdee79e
cybersource.merchantsecretkey=k6mXIYoPxYuu4m9WHZT+dfWlGzP0oWfk+2f3V/lVADs=
cybersource.merchantid=thebeaconsarelit
cybersource.apihost=apitest.cybersource.com
```
